This is a learning exercise to showcase that I can create front-end web development projects where I use both static and dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The HTML simply has a title, an H1 line and H2 line, and a button with inner HTML that has an onclick function. It also links the stylesheet and the script.
The CSS makes the site look better with button states, backgrounds, an image for the button, and a text family and shadows.
The javascript makes the onclick function randomly pick an image file from a predetermined array and then appends it at the bottom of the website when pressed.
The layout of the website makes it so that you have to scroll back to the top to keep clicking the button. This is on purpose because I thought it would be funny.
