this is a test of my ability of front-end development where i use both static and dynamic html, css and javascript.
It is a website with a button which randomly picks an image file from a predetermined array and then displays it at the bottom of the website when pressed.
The layout of the website makes it to where you have to scroll back to the top to keep clicking the button. This is on purpose because I thought it would be funny.
